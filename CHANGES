===== 5.6.1 =====

====== Fixes ======

  *  Fix null file descriptor being closed when used as redirection for standard fd of child processes. (#957, Antonin Décimo)

===== 5.6.0 =====

  * In the Lwt_io module, add `?cloexec:bool` optional arguments to functions that create file descriptors (`pipe`). The `?cloexec` argument is simply forwarded to the wrapped Lwt_unix function. (#872, #911, Antonin Décimo)
  * Add Lwt_result.error, Lwt_result.iter, and Lwt_result.iter_error for consistency with Stdlib. (#927, Antonin Décimo)
  * Lwt_result.bind_error. (#943, Boning Dong)
  * Add ?cloexec parameter to Lwt_io.pipe. (#911, Antonin Décimo)

  * Use the WSA_FLAG_NO_HANDLE_INHERIT on Windows when creating sockets with WSASocket if the cloexec (non-inheritable) parameter is true. Fixes a Windows problem where a child process would inherit a supposedly non-inheritable socket. (#910, Antonin Décimo)
  * Fix macOS/arm64 tests which have a 16k page. (#932, Kate Deplaix)
  * Fix Lwt_unix.closedir incorrectly checking the return value of closedir(3). (#942, Antonin Décimo)

====== Deprecations ======

  * Lwt_main.yield and Lwt_unix.yield are deprecated in favor of the generic Lwt.pause, and Lwt_unix.auto_yield is deprecated in favor of the new Lwt_unix.auto_pause. Currently, Lwt_main.run resolves paused promises more frequently than yielded promises; the difference is unintended but existing applications could unintentionally depend on it. (#855, #858, Favonia)

====== Fixes ======

  * Use is_blocking in dup and dup2 to fix ENOTSOCK on Windows. (#869, Antonin Décimo)

  * Lwt_unix.lstat was incorrectly calling Unix.stat on Win32. Fixes the behavior of Lwt_io.with_temp_dir following symlinks to directories on Win32. (#883, Antonin Décimo)

  * Support deleting symlinks on Windows during cleanup of Lwt_io.with_temp_dir. (#886, Antonin Décimo)

  * Lwt_react.S.l[2-6]_s used polymorphic equality which could cause errors when handling functional values. (#893, Jérôme Vouillon)

  * On Windows, treat ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE on read as zero-read instead of error. See OCaml PR #4790. (#898, Antonin Décimo)

  * Fix compilation under MSVC by replacing Noreturn with CAMLnoreturn. (#880, #887, Nicolás Ojeda Bär)

====== Additions ======

  * Lwt_bytes.blit_from_string: string complement of Lwt_bytes.blit. (#882, Hugo Heuzard)

  * Lwt_seq: a Seq-like data-structure with Lwt delayed nodes. (#836, #842, Zach Shipko)

  * Lwt_unix.auto_pause: the replacement of Lwt_unix.auto_yield that uses Lwt.pause instead of Lwt_unix.yield. (#855, #858, Favonia)

  * Lwt_stream.return, Lwt_stream.return_lwt: singleton stream constructors. (#864, Boning Dong)

  * Add ?to_dir param from Unix.symlink to Lwt_unix.symlink wrapper. (#884, Antonin Décimo)

  * Lwt_stream.of_lwt_seq to convert an Lwt-sequence into an Lwt-stream. (#873)

  * Support IPv6 (always) and PF_UNIX (with OCaml >= 4.14) socketpair on Windows. (#870, #876, Antonin Décimo, David Allsopp)

  * In the Lwt_unix module, add `?cloexec:bool` optional arguments to functions that create file descriptors (`dup`, `dup2`, `pipe`, `pipe_in`, `pipe_out`, `socket`, `socketpair`, `accept`, `accept_n`). The `?cloexec` argument is simply forwarded to the wrapped Unix function (with OCaml >= 4.05, see PR ocaml/ocaml#650), or emulated as best-effort with `Unix.set_close_on_exec` on older OCaml versions. (#327, #847, #872, #901, Antonin Décimo)

  * Lwt_domain: helpers for using domainslib from Lwt. (#860, Sudha Parimala)

====== Misc ======

  * Code quality improvement: remove an unneeded Obj.magic. (#844, Benoit Montagu)

  * On Windows, use the Unicode API in C stubs and functions introduced in OCaml 4.06 to handle Unicode strings. Raise the minimum requirement to OCaml 4.06 (on Windows only). (#843, #903, Antonin Décimo)

  * More complete coverage in the CI. (#890, #894, #896, Sora Morimoto)

  * Code quality improvement: use exception pattern instead of try-with. (#895, Antonin Décimo)

  * Code quality improvement: fix warnings on 4.13. (#899)


===== 5.4.2 =====

  * Lwt_main.abandon_yielded_and_paused for use in conjunction with Lwt.fork (#789, Julien Tesson).

  * Lwt.wrap_in_cancelable to complete protect and no_cancel (#785).

  * Lwt.dont_wait, a more explicit alternative to Lwt.async (#820, François Thiré).

====== Miscellaneous ======

  * Avoid double-reversing when traversing lists. This may change the order in which some promises are collected, which may change which of several rejection is arbitrarily selected during concurrent traversal (#784).

  * Numerous documentation improvements (including external contributions from Bikal Lem, Sudha Parimala, and Hannes Mehnert).

  * Documentation improvements (#544, #546, #547, #553, #559, Daniil Baturin,
    Jason Evans, Jess Smith, Milo Turner).

===== 3.2.1 (2018-01-11) =====

Lwt 3.2.1 is released because it still packages lwt.ppx, a deprecated copy of
package lwt_ppx, and the two packages should be kept in sync.

====== Deprecations ======

  * All PPX options are deprecated and should not be used (#534).
  * The [%lwt ...] PPX syntax should be replaced by Lwt.catch (#534).

====== Fixes ======

  * Clean up PPX -help usage message output (#525, Zan Doye).

====== Miscellaneous ======

  * More thorough testing (#512, #535, Joseph Thomas).
  * Clarification of the C binding (#521, @cedlemo).

===== 3.2.0 (2017-12-19) =====

====== Additions ======

  * Lwt_mvar.take_available, Lwt_mvar.is_empty (#459, Hezekiah Carty).
  * Lwt_io.open_temp_file, Lwt_io.with_temp_file (#467, Joe Thomas).
  * New reference documentation for module Lwt (#469).
  * Lwt_pool.clear and ?dispose argument for Lwt_pool.create (#483,
    Hezekiah Carty).
  * Lwt_pool.wait_queue_length (#493, Jerome Vouillon).

====== Bugs fixed ======

  * Lwt.npick never worked (#447, Zack Coker).
  * Lwt_pool.use now always calls ?validate on elements (#461, Joe Thomas).
  * Better locations generated by the PPX (#470, Fabian Hemmer).

====== Planned to break in 4.0.0 ======

See #453 for details and instructions about planned breakage in Lwt 4.0.0.

  * The semantics of Lwt will be adjusted for better exception and stack safety
    (#500).
  * The PPX will be factored out into its own opam package, lwt_ppx. This
    package is installable from opam now, as of Lwt 3.2.0 (#338).
  * Similarly, the deprecated Camlp4 syntax will be factored out into
    lwt_camlp4, which is installable from opam now (#370).
  * Modules Lwt_log, Lwt_log_core, Lwt_log_rules, and Lwt_daemon are being
    deprecated and factored out into opam package lwt_log, also installable from
    opam now. Use the logs library for logging, in particular module Logs_lwt.
    Direct daemonization is deprecated on most platforms (#484, Hannes Mehnert).
  * The >> construct from the PPX will be deleted (#471, Raphaël Proust).
  * Package lwt.preemptive is being merged into lwt.unix. In 3.2.0,
    lwt.preemptive becomes an alias for lwt.unix, and the package name
    lwt.preemptive will be deleted in 4.0.0 (#487).

====== Deprecations ======

  * Lwt.waiter_of_wakener should not be used, as it can lead to soundness bugs
    in future (but not current) Lwt (#458).
  * Lwt_sequence was deprecated in Lwt 2.6.0, but it now has a warning attached,
    as do Lwt.add_task_r and Lwt.add_task_l, which use it (#361).
  * Use of the following functions is discouraged, but they have not yet
    received deprecation warnings: Lwt.with_value, Lwt.cancel, Lwt.state,
    Lwt.ignore_result (#359, #469).

====== Miscellaneous ======

  * Replace references to Camlp4 in the manual with the PPX (#457, Bobby
    Priambodo).
  * More tests for Lwt_pool (#464, Joe Thomas).
  * Expect tests for the PPX (#474, Fabian Hemmer).

    some fds (#356, David Sheets).
  * Lwt_unix.sleep and Lwt_unix.timeout returning too early when using
    libev (#433, Stijn Devriendt).
  * Lwt_sequence.fold_r iterating the wrong way in some cases (#405,
    Stijn Devriendt).
  * Build conflicts in some cases due to duplicate cst_to_constr
    function (#362, Jérémie Dimino).
  * Don't use deprecated readdir_r system call (#430, Raphaël Proust).

====== Miscellaneous ======

  * The Lwt core, lwt.ml, has been thoroughly refactored and commented
    (#354, reviewed Gabriel Radanne, Edwin Török, Raphaël Proust, Jan
    Doms, Fabian Hemmer, Sebastien Mondet, Simon Cruanes, Anil
    Madhavapeddy, Pierre Chambart, and many others).
  * Lots of tests for most of the Lwt core (#339, #389, #392, #440,
    #448, #450, Joseph Thomas, Ryan Slade).
  * Documentation fixes (including by Joseph Thomas, Raphaël Proust,
    Richard Degenne, Stavros Polymenis).
  * Contributing documentation (#379).
  * Massively adjust whitespace for legibility (#400, #409, #416,
    Richard Degenne).
  * Improvements to CI (Etienne Millon, Raphael Rafatpanah, Zack Coker,
    Yotam Barnoy).
  * The additional packages lwt_ssl, lwt_react, lwt_glib get new minor
    releases, the change being new Jbuilder build systems (#374, Andrew
    Ray).

===== 3.0.0 (2017-04-10) =====

====== Breaking ======

  * These changes were originally announced in release 2.7.0 (#308).
  * Lwt_engine.libev now has an optional argument for selecting the libev back
    end (#269, #294, Jeremy Yallop).
  * Lwt_io.establish_server has been changed to make it more difficult to leak
    file descriptors (#258, #260).
  * Lwt_io.shutdown_server now evaluates to a promise, which completes when the
    listening socket's close(2) operation completes (#259).
  * Lwt_unix.bind now evaluates to a promise, because the bind(2) system call
    can block for Unix domain sockets (#296, requested David Sheets).
  * ocamlfind packages lwt.react, lwt.ssl, lwt.glib are replaced by lwt_react,
    lwt_ssl, lwt_glib. These have been separate OPAM packages, under those
    names, since 2.7.0 (#301).

====== Fixes ======

  * OCaml 4.05 compatibility (Mauricio Fernandez, #322).

====== Additions ======

  * Announce Lwt_result, which was originally released as an experimental module
    in release 2.6.0 (Simon Cruanes, #320, #247).

===== 2.7.0 (2017-01-03) =====

====== General ======

  * Values of types a Lwt.t are now referred to as promises rather than threads
    (#300). The manual has not yet been updated.

====== Breaking ======

  * After this release, Lwt will switch to semantic versioning. Future breaking
    changes will first require deprecation, then a major version number increase
    (#293).
  * Lwt no longer supports OCaml 4.01 (#272).
  * Lwt_unix.fdatasync is no longer available on macOS. It was calling an
    undocumented system call on that system (#285, Jeremy Yallop).

====== Planned to break in 3.0.0 ======

  * APIs in this category have deprecation messages attached. The messages will
    be displayed if you recompile your code, and can also be seen in #308.
  * Lwt_engine.libev will have an argument for selecting the libev back end
    (#269, #294, Jeremy Yallop).
  * Lwt_io.establish_server will be replaced by a version that makes it
    difficult to leak file descriptors (#258, #260).
  * Lwt_io.shutdown_server will evaluate to a promise, which indicates when the
    close operation completes (#259).
  * Lwt_unix.bind will evaluate to a promise, since bind can block for Unix
    domain sockets (#296, requested David Sheets).
  * ocamlfind packages lwt.react, lwt.ssl, and lwt.glib will be replaced by the
    new lwt_react, lwt_ssl, and lwt_glib. These are now distributed in new OPAM
    packages with the same names, separately from OPAM package lwt (#301).

====== Additions ======

  * Lwt_unix.readv and Lwt_unix.writev - zero-copy scatter/gather I/O
    (#291, #299).

    immediately push all elements into the created streams
    (#239, Spiros Eliopoulos).

    ** {{{Lwt_read_line}}} for interactive user input
    ** {{{Lwt_monitor}}}, {{{Lwt_mvar}}}: combined locks for
       synchronization with conditional variables for notification
    ** {{{Lwt_throttle}}} for limiting rate of execution
       (e.g. for authentication procedure)
    ** {{{Lwt_sequence}}}: mutable sequence of elements
    ** {{{Lwt_event}}}, {{{Lwt_signal}}}: helpers for reactive
       programming with lwt
  * Adding a syntax extension {{{pa_lwt}}}:
    ** handles anonymous bind {{{a >> b}}}
    ** adds syntactic sugar for catching errors (ticket #6)
    ** adds syntactic sugar for parallel let-binding construction
    ** adds syntactic sugar for for-like loops
  * Top-level integration:
    ** threads can runs while reading user input
    ** line editing support
  * New enhanced OCaml toplevel with some basic completion features
  * Adding C stubs to reimplement {{{Unix.read}}} and {{{Unix.write}}}
    with assumption of non-blocking behaviour
  * Adding more functions/helpers in {{{Lwt}}}
  * Fixing memory leaks in {{{Lwt.choose}}}
  * Bugfix in {{{Lwt_chan.close_*}}} (ticket #66)
  * Separate the type of threads (covariant) from the type of thread
    wakeners (contravariant); the type of many functions related to
    {{{Lwt.wait}}} has been changed
  * Add cancelable threads
  * Unix-dependent part is now put in its own archive and findlib
    package.

===== 1.1.0 (2008-06-25) =====

  * Adding module {{{Lwt_pool}}} for creating pools (for example pools
    of connections)
  * Adding a few functions in {{{Lwt_chan}}}
  * Fixing bugs in {{{Lwt_util.map_serial}}} and
    {{{Lwt_util.iter_serial}}}
  * Putting {{{Lwt_preemptive}}}, {{{Lwt_lib}}} and {{{Lwt_ssl}}} in
    separate libraries and findlib subpackages so that lwt.cma depends
    only on unix.cma.

===== 1.0.0 (and before) =====

  * See Ocsigen changelog
