(** Helpers for test *)

type t
  (** Type of a test *)

type suite
  (** Type of a suite of tests *)

val test_direct : string -> ?only_if:(unit -> bool) -> (unit -> bool) -> t
  (** Defines a test. [run] must returns [true] if the test succeeded
      and [false] otherwise. [only_if] is used to conditionally skip the
      test. *)

val test : string -> ?only_if:(unit -> bool) -> (unit -> bool Lwt.t) -> t
  (** Like [test_direct], but defines a test which runs a thread. *)

val suite : string -> t list -> suite
  (** Defines a suite of tests *)

val run : string -> suite list -> unit
  (** Run all the given tests and exit the program with an exit code
      of [0] if all tests succeeded and with [1] otherwise. *)

val temp_name : unit -> string
(** Generates the name of a temporary file (or directory) in [_build/]. Note
    that a file at the path may already exist. *)

val temp_file : unit -> string
(** Creates a temporary file in [_build/] and evaluates to its path. *)

val temp_directory : unit -> string
(** Creates a temporary directory in [build/] and evaluates to its path. *)
