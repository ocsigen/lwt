(** React utilities *)

(** This module is an overlay for the [React] module. You can open it
    instead of the [React] module in order to get all of [React]'s functions
    plus Lwt ones.

    This module is provided by OPAM package [lwt_react]. Link with ocamlfind
    package [lwt_react]. *)

type 'a event = 'a React.event

  val with_finaliser : (unit -> unit) -> 'a event -> 'a event
    (** [with_finaliser f e] returns an event [e'] which behave as
        [e], except that [f] is called when [e'] is garbage
        collected. *)

  val next : 'a event -> 'a Lwt.t
    (** [next e] returns the next occurrence of [e] *)

  val limit : (unit -> unit Lwt.t) -> 'a event -> 'a event
    (** [limit f e] limits the rate of [e] with [f].

        For example, to limit the rate of an event to 1 per second you
        can use: [limit (fun () -> Lwt_unix.sleep 1.0) event]. *)

  val from : (unit -> 'a Lwt.t) -> 'a event
    (** [from f] creates an event which occurs each time [f ()]
        returns a value. If [f] raises an exception, the event is just
        stopped. *)

  val to_stream : 'a event -> 'a Lwt_stream.t
    (** Creates a stream holding all values occurring on the given
        event *)

  val of_stream : 'a Lwt_stream.t -> 'a event
    (** [of_stream stream] creates an event which occurs each time a
        value is available on the stream. *)

  val delay : 'a event Lwt.t -> 'a event
    (** [delay promise] is an event which does not occur until
        [promise] resolves. Then it behaves as the event returned by
        [promise]. *)

  val keep : 'a event -> unit
    (** [keep e] keeps a reference to [e] so it will never be garbage
        collected. *)

  (** {2 Threaded versions of React transformation functions} *)

  (** The following functions behave as their [React] counterpart,
      except that they take functions that may yield.

      As usual the [_s] suffix is used when calls are serialized, and
      the [_p] suffix is used when they are not.

      Note that [*_p] functions may not preserve event order. *)

        signal f] is set to [f y], until the next change of
