(** Logging facility *)

(** This module provides functions to deal with logging.
    It extends {!Lwt_log_core} with Unix features.
    It adds:

    - logging to the syslog daemon
    - logging to a channel (stderr, stdout, ...)
    - logging to a file
*)

include module type of Lwt_log_core
  with type level = Lwt_log_core.level
   and type logger = Lwt_log_core.logger
   and type section = Lwt_log_core.section
   and type template = Lwt_log_core.template
   and module Section = Lwt_log_core.Section

val render : buffer : Buffer.t -> template : template -> section : section -> level : level -> message : string -> unit
  (** Same as {!Lwt_log_core.render}, except that the template may also contain the
      following variables:

      - [date], which will be replaced with the current local date and time,
      - [milliseconds], which will be replaced by the fractional part of the current Unix
        time, to millisecond accuracy.

      For example:
        - ["$(date) $(name)[$(pid)]: $(message)"]
        - ["$(date).$(milliseconds) $(name)[$(pid)]: $(message)"]
        - ["$(date): $(loc-file): $(loc-line): $(loc-column): $(message)"]
  *)

(** Syslog facility. Look at the SYSLOG(3) man page for a description
    of syslog facilities *)

val syslog : ?template : template -> ?paths : string list -> facility : syslog_facility -> unit -> logger
  (** [syslog ?template ?paths ~facility ()] creates an logger
      which send message to the system logger.

      @param paths is a list of path to try for the syslogd socket. It
             default to [\["/dev/log"; "/var/run/log"\]].
      @param template defaults to ["$(date) $(name)[$(pid)]: $(section): $(message)"]

  (** [desf_file ?template ?mode ?perm ~file_name ()] creates an
      logger which will write messages to [file_name].

      - if [mode = `Truncate] then the file is truncated and previous
      contents will be lost.

      - if [mode = `Append], new messages will be appended at the end
      of the file

      @param mode defaults to [`Append]
      @param template defaults to ["$(date): $(section): $(message)"]
  *)

val channel :?template : template -> close_mode : [ `Close | `Keep ] -> channel : Lwt_io.output_channel -> unit -> logger
  (** [channel ?template ~close_mode ~channel ()] creates a logger
      from a channel.

      If [close_mode = `Close] then [channel] is closed when the
      logger is closed, otherwise it is left open.

      @param template defaults to ["$(name): $(section): $(message)"] *)
