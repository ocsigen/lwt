(** Interaction with the garbage collector *)

(** This module offers a convenient way to add a finaliser launching a
    thread to a value, without having to use [Lwt_unix.run] in the
    finaliser. *)

val finalise : ('a -> unit Lwt.t) -> 'a -> unit
  (** [finalise f x] ensures [f x] is evaluated after [x] has been
      garbage collected. If [f x] yields, then Lwt will wait for its
      termination at the end of the program.

      Note that [f x] is not called at garbage collection time, but
      later in the main loop. *)

val finalise_or_exit : ('a -> unit Lwt.t) -> 'a -> unit
  (** [finalise_or_exit f x] call [f x] when [x] is garbage collected
      or (exclusively) when the program exits. *)
