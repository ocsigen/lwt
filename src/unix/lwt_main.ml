         present in all versions of OCaml supported by Lwt, where, with the
         bytecode runtime, if one changes the working directory and then attempts
         to retrieve the backtrace, the runtime calls [abort] at the C level and
         exits the program ungracefully. It is especially likely that a daemon
         would change directory before calling [Lwt_main.run], so we can't have it
         retrieving the backtrace, even though a daemon is not likely to be
         compiled to bytecode.

         This can be addressed with detection. Starting with 4.04, there is a
         type [Sys.backend_type] that could be used. *)
