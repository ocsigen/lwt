       present in all versions of OCaml supported by Lwt, where, with the
       bytecode runtime, if one changes the working directory and then attempts
       to retrieve the backtrace, the runtime calls [abort] at the C level and
       exits the program ungracefully. It is especially likely that a daemon
       would change directory before calling [Lwt_main.run], so we can't have it
       retrieving the backtrace, even though a daemon is not likely to be
       compiled to bytecode.

       This can be addressed with detection. Starting with 4.04, there is a
       type [Sys.backend_type] that could be used. *)
