(** Buffered byte channels *)

(** A {b channel} is a high-level object for performing input/output
    (IO). It allows to read/write from/to the outside world in an
    efficient way, by minimising the number of system calls.

    An {b output channel} is used to send data and an {b input
    channel} is used to receive data.

    If you are familiar with buffered channels you may be familiar too
    with the {b flush} operation. Note that byte channels of this
    module are automatically flushed when there is nothing else to do
    (i.e. before the program becomes idle), so this means that you no
    longer have to write:

    {[
      eprintf "log message\n";
      flush stderr;
    ]}

    to have your messages displayed.

    Note about errors: input functions of this module raise
    [End_of_file] when the end-of-file is reached (i.e. when the read
    function returns [0]). Other exceptions are ones caused by the
    backend read/write functions, such as [Unix.Unix_error].
*)

    The corresponding writing function is {!write_value}.

    Note that reading marshaled values is {e not}, in general, type-safe. See
    the warning in the description of module
    {{:https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Marshal.html}
    [Marshal]} for details. The short version is: if you read a value of one

    including segmentation faults, access violations, security bugs, etc. *)

(** Note: as for reading functions, all functions except
    {!write_chars} and {!write_lines} are {b atomic}.

    For example if you use {!write_line} in two different threads, the
    two operations will be serialized, and lines cannot be mixed.

    {{:https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Marshal.html#VALto_channel}
    [Marshal.to_channel]} for an explanation of [?flags].

    The corresponding reading function is {!read_value}. See warnings about type
    safety in the description of {!read_value}. *)

(** {2 Printing} *)

(** These functions are basically helpers. Also you may prefer
    using the name {!printl} rather than {!write_line} because it is
    shorter.

    The general name of a printing function is [<prefix>print<suffixes>],

    where [<prefix>] is one of:
    - ['f'], which means that the function takes as argument a channel
    - nothing, which means that the function prints on {!stdout}
    - ['e'], which means that the function prints on {!stderr}

    and [<suffixes>] is a combination of:
    - ['l'] which means that a new-line character is printed after the message
    - ['f'] which means that the function takes as argument a {b format} instead
    of a string
*)

    [~mode:Input]) or for writing (with [~mode:Output]). The returned channel
    provides buffered I/O on the file.

    If [~buffer] is supplied, it is used as the I/O buffer.

    If [~flags] is supplied, the file is opened with the given flags (see
    {{: https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Unix.html#TYPEopen_flag}
    [Unix.open_flag]}). Note that [~flags] is used {e exactly} as given. For
    example, opening a file with [~flags] and [~mode:Input] does {e not}
    implicitly add [O_RDONLY]. So, you should include [O_RDONLY] when opening
    for reading ([~mode:Input]), and [O_WRONLY] when opening for writing
    ([~mode:Input]). It is also recommended to include [O_NONBLOCK], unless you
    are sure that the file cannot be a socket or a named pipe.

    The default permissions used for creating new files are [0o666], i.e.
    reading and writing are allowed for the file owner, group, and everyone.
    These default permissions can be overridden by supplying [~perm].

    Note: if opening for writing ([~mode:Output]), and the file already exists,
    [open_file] truncates (clears) the file by default. If you would like to
    keep the pre-existing contents of the file, use the [~flags] parameter to

(** [establish_server_with_client_socket listen_address f] creates a server
    which listens for incoming connections on [listen_address]. When a client
    makes a new connection, it is passed to [f]: more precisely, the server
    calls

{[
f client_address client_socket
]}

    where [client_address] is the address (peer name) of the new client, and
    [client_socket] is the socket connected to the client.

    The server does not block waiting for [f] to complete: it concurrently tries
    to accept more client connections while [f] is handling the client.

    When the promise returned by [f] completes (i.e., [f] is done handling the
    client), [establish_server_with_client_socket] automatically closes
    [client_socket]. This is a default behavior that is useful for simple cases,
    but for a robust application you should explicitly close these channels
    yourself, and handle any exceptions as appropriate. If the channels are
    still open when [f] completes, and their automatic closing raises an
    exception, [establish_server_with_client_address] treats it as an unhandled
    exception reaching the top level of the application: it passes that
    exception to {!Lwt.async_exception_hook}, the default behavior of which is
    to print the exception and {e terminate your process}.

    Automatic closing can be completely disabled by passing [~no_close:true].

    Similarly, if [f] raises an exception (or the promise it returns fails with
    an exception), [establish_server_with_client_address] can do nothing with
    that exception, except pass it to {!Lwt.async_exception_hook}.

    [~server_fd] can be specified to use an existing file descriptor for
    listening. Otherwise, a fresh socket is created internally. In either case,
    [establish_server_with_client_socket] will internally assign
    [listen_address] to the server socket.

    [~backlog] is the argument passed to {!Lwt_unix.listen}.

    The returned promise (a [server Lwt.t]) resolves when the server has just
    started listening on [listen_address]: right after the internal call to
