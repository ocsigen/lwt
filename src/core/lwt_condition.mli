(** Conditions *)

(** Condition variables to synchronize between threads. *)

type 'a t
    (** Condition variable type. The type parameter denotes the type of
        value propagated from notifier to waiter. *)

val create : unit -> 'a t
    (** [create ()] creates a new condition variable. *)

val wait : ?mutex:Lwt_mutex.t -> 'a t -> 'a Lwt.t
    (** [wait mutex condvar] will cause the current thread to block,
        awaiting notification for a condition variable, [condvar]. If
        provided, the [mutex] must have been previously locked (within
        the scope of [Lwt_mutex.with_lock], for example) and is
        temporarily unlocked until the condition is notified. Upon
        notification, [mutex] is re-locked before [wait] returns and
        the thread's activity is resumed. When the awaited condition
        is notified, the value parameter passed to [notify] is
        returned. *)

val signal : 'a t -> 'a -> unit
    (** [signal condvar value] notifies that a condition is ready. A
        single waiting thread will be awoken and will receive the
        notification value which will be returned from [wait]. Note
        that condition notification is not "sticky", i.e. if there is
        no waiter when [notify] is called, the notification will be
        missed and the value discarded. *)

val broadcast : 'a t -> 'a -> unit
    (** [broadcast condvar value] notifies all waiting threads. Each
        will be awoken in turn and will receive the same notification
        value. *)
