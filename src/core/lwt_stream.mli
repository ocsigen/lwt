(** Data streams *)

type 'a t
  (** Type of a stream holding values of type ['a] *)

(** Naming convention: in this module all function taking a function
    which is applied to all element of the streams are suffixed by:

    - [_s] when the function returns a thread and calls are serialised
    - [_p] when the function returns a thread and calls are parallelised
*)

(** {6 Construction} *)

val from : (unit -> 'a option Lwt.t) -> 'a t
  (** [from f] creates an stream from the given input function. [f] is
      called each time more input is needed, and the stream ends when
      [f] returns [None]. *)

val from_direct : (unit -> 'a option) -> 'a t
  (** [from_direct f] does the same as {!from} but with a function
      that does not return a thread. It is better than wrapping [f]
      into a function which return a thread. *)

exception Closed
  (** Exception raised by the push function of a push-stream when
      pushing an element after the end of stream ([= None]) have been
      pushed. *)

val create : unit -> 'a t * ('a option -> unit)
  (** [create ()] returns a new stream and a push function. *)

val create_with_reference : unit -> 'a t * ('a option -> unit) * ('b -> unit)
  (** [create_with_reference ()] returns a new stream and a push
      function. The last function allows to set a reference to an
      external source. This prevent the external source from being
      garbage collected.

      For example, to convert a reactive event to a stream:

      {[
        let stream, push, set_ref = Lwt_stream.create_with_reference () in
        set_ref (map_event push event)
      ]}
  *)

exception Full
  (** Exception raised by the push function of a bounded push-stream
      when the stream queue is full and a thread is already waiting to
      push an element. *)

(** Type of sources for bounded push-streams. *)
class type ['a] bounded_push = object
  method size : int
    (** Size of the stream. *)

  method resize : int -> unit
    (** Change the size of the stream queue. Note that the new size
        can smaller than the current stream queue size.

        It raises [Invalid_argument] if [size < 0]. *)

  method push : 'a -> unit Lwt.t
    (** Pushes a new element to the stream. If the stream is full then
        it will block until one element is consumed. If another thread
        is already blocked on {!push}, it raises {!Full}. *)

  method close : unit
    (** Closes the stream. Any thread currently blocked on {!push}
        will fail with {!Closed}. *)

  method count : int
    (** Number of elements in the stream queue. *)

  method blocked : bool
    (** Is a thread is blocked on {!push} ? *)

  method closed : bool
    (** Is the stream closed ? *)

  method set_reference : 'a. 'a -> unit
    (** Set the reference to an external source. *)
end

val create_bounded : int -> 'a t * 'a bounded_push
  (** [create_bounded size] returns a new stream and a bounded push
      source. The stream can hold a maximum of [size] elements.  When
      this limit is reached, pushing a new element will block until
      one is consumed.

      Note that you cannot clone or parse (with {!parse}) a bounded
      stream. These functions will raise [Invalid_argument] if you try
      to do so.

      It raises [Invalid_argument] if [size < 0]. *)

val of_list : 'a list -> 'a t
  (** [of_list l] creates a stream returning all elements of [l] *)

val of_array : 'a array -> 'a t
  (** [of_array a] creates a stream returning all elements of [a] *)

val of_string : string -> char t
  (** [of_string str] creates a stream returning all characters of
      [str] *)

val clone : 'a t -> 'a t
  (** [clone st] clone the given stream. Operations on each stream
      will not affect the other.

      For example:

      {[
        # let st1 = Lwt_stream.of_list [1; 2; 3];;
        val st1 : int Lwt_stream.t = <abstr>
        # let st2 = Lwt_stream.clone st1;;
        val st2 : int Lwt_stream.t = <abstr>
        # lwt x = Lwt_stream.next st1;;
        val x : int = 1
        # lwt y = Lwt_stream.next st2;;
        val y : int = 1
      ]}

      It raises [Invalid_argument] if [st] is a bounded
      push-stream. *)

  (** Returns the list of elements of the given stream *)

val to_string : char t -> string Lwt.t
  (** Returns the word composed of all characters of the given
      stream *)

(** {6 Data retreival} *)

exception Empty
  (** Exception raised when trying to retreive data from an empty
      stream. *)

val peek : 'a t -> 'a option Lwt.t
  (** [peek st] returns the first element of the stream, if any,
      without removing it. *)

val npeek : int -> 'a t -> 'a list Lwt.t
  (** [npeek n st] returns at most the first [n] elements of [st],
      without removing them. *)

  (** [get st] remove and returns the first element of the stream, if
      any. *)

val nget : int -> 'a t -> 'a list Lwt.t
  (** [nget n st] remove and returns at most the first [n] elements of
      [st]. *)

val get_while : ('a -> bool) -> 'a t -> 'a list Lwt.t
val get_while_s : ('a -> bool Lwt.t) -> 'a t -> 'a list Lwt.t
  (** [get_while f st] returns the longest prefix of [st] where all
      elements satisfy [f]. *)

val next : 'a t -> 'a Lwt.t
  (** [next st] remove and returns the next element of the stream, of
      fail with {!Empty} if the stream is empty. *)

val last_new : 'a t -> 'a Lwt.t
  (** [last_new st] returns the last element that can be obtained
      without sleepping, or wait for one if no one is already
      available.

      If fails with {!Empty} if the stream has no more elements *)

val junk : 'a t -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [junk st] remove the first element of [st]. *)

val njunk : int -> 'a t -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [njunk n st] removes at most the first [n] elements of the
      stream. *)

val junk_while : ('a -> bool) -> 'a t -> unit Lwt.t
val junk_while_s : ('a -> bool Lwt.t) -> 'a t -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [junk_while f st] removes all elements at the beginning of the
      streams which satisfy [f]. *)

val junk_old : 'a t -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [junk_old st] removes all elements that are ready to be read
      without yeilding from [st].

      For example the [read_password] function of [Lwt_read_line] use
      that to junk key previously typed by the user.
  *)

val get_available : 'a t -> 'a list
  (** [get_available st] returns all available elements of [l] without
      blocking *)

val get_available_up_to : int -> 'a t -> 'a list
  (** [get_available_up_to n st] returns up to [n] elements of [l]
      without blocking *)

val is_empty : 'a t -> bool Lwt.t
  (** [is_empty st] returns wether the given stream is empty *)

val on_terminate : 'a t -> (unit -> unit) -> unit
  (** [on_terminate st f] executes [f] when the end of the stream [st]
      is reached. Note that the stream may still contains elements if
      {!peek} or similar was used. *)

(** {6 Stream transversal} *)

(** Note: all the following functions are destructive.

    For example:

    {[
      # let st1 = Lwt_stream.of_list [1; 2; 3];;
      val st1 : int Lwt_stream.t = <abstr>
      # let st2 = Lwt_stream.map string_of_int st1;;
      val st2 : string Lwt_stream.t = <abstr>

      val x : int = 1
      # lwt y = Lwt_stream.next st2;;
      val y : string = "2"
    ]}
*)

val choose : 'a t list -> 'a t
  (** [choose l] creates an stream from a list of streams. The
      resulting stream will returns elements returned by any stream of

val filter : ('a -> bool) -> 'a t -> 'a t
val filter_s : ('a -> bool Lwt.t) -> 'a t -> 'a t
  (** [filter f st] keeps only value [x] such that [f x] is [true] *)

val filter_map : ('a -> 'b option) -> 'a t -> 'b t
val filter_map_s : ('a -> 'b option Lwt.t) -> 'a t -> 'b t
  (** [filter_map f st] filter and map [st] at the same time *)

val map_list : ('a -> 'b list) -> 'a t -> 'b t
val map_list_s : ('a -> 'b list Lwt.t) -> 'a t -> 'b t

val map_exn : 'a t -> 'a result t
  (** [map_exn s] returns a stream that captures all exceptions raised
      by the source of the stream (the function passed to {!from}).

      Note that for push-streams (as returned by {!create}) all
