(** Mutable sequence of elements *)

(** A sequence is an object holding a list of elements which support
    the following operations:

    - adding an element to the left or the right in time and space O(1)
    - taking an element from the left or the right in time and space O(1)
    - removing a previously added element from a sequence in time and space O(1)
    - removing an element while the sequence is being transversed.

type 'a t
  (** Type of a sequence holding values of type ['a] *)

type 'a node
  (** Type of a node holding one value of type ['a] in a sequence *)

(** {6 Operation on nodes} *)

val get : 'a node -> 'a
  (** Returns the contents of a node *)

val set : 'a node -> 'a -> unit
  (** Change the contents of a node *)

val remove : 'a node -> unit
  (** Removes a node from the sequence it is part of. It does nothing
      if the node has already been removed. *)

val is_empty : 'a t -> bool
  (** Returns [true] iff the given sequence is empty *)

val length : 'a t -> int
  (** Returns the number of elemenets in the given sequence. This is a
      O(n) operation where [n] is the number of elements in the
      sequence. *)
