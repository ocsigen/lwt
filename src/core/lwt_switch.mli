(** Lwt switches *)

(** Switch has two goals:

    - being able to free multiple resources at the same time,
    - offer a better alternative than always returning an id to free
      some resource.

    For example, consider the following interface:

    {[
      type id

      val free : id -> unit Lwt.t

      val f : unit -> id Lwt.t
      val g : unit -> id Lwt.t
      val h : unit -> id Lwt.t
    ]}

    Now you want to call [f], [g] and [h] in parallel. You can
    simply do:

    {[
      lwt idf = f () and idg = g () and idh = h () in
      ...
    ]}

    However, one may want to handle possible failures of [f ()], [g
    ()] and [h ()], and disable all allocated resources if one of
    these three threads fails. This may be hard since you have to
    remember which one failed and which one returned correctly.

    Now if we change the interface a little bit:

    {[
      val f : ?switch : Lwt_switch.t -> unit -> id Lwt.t
      val g : ?switch : Lwt_switch.t -> unit -> id Lwt.t
      val h : ?switch : Lwt_switch.t -> unit -> id Lwt.t
    ]}

    the code becomes:

    {[
      Lwt_switch.with_switch (fun switch ->
        lwt idf = f ~switch ()
        and idg = g ~switch ()
        and idh = h ~switch () in
        ...
      )
    ]}
*)

type t
  (** Type of switches. *)

val create : unit -> t
  (** [create ()] creates a new switch. *)

val with_switch : (t -> 'a Lwt.t) -> 'a Lwt.t
  (** [with_switch fn] is [fn switch], where [switch] is a fresh switch
      that is turned off when the callback thread finishes (whether it
      succeeds or fails).

      @since 2.6.0 *)

val is_on : t -> bool
  (** [is_on switch] returns [true] if the switch is currently on, and
      [false] otherwise. *)

val turn_off : t -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [turn_off switch] turns off the switch. It calls all registered
      hooks, waits for all of them to terminate, then returns. If
      one of the hooks failed, it will fail with the exception raised
      by the hook. If the switch is already off, it does nothing. *)

exception Off
  (** Exception raised when trying to add a hook to a switch that is
      already off. *)

val check : t option -> unit
  (** [check switch] does nothing if [switch] is [None] or contains an
      switch that is currently on, and raises {!Off} otherwise. *)

val add_hook : t option -> (unit -> unit Lwt.t) -> unit
  (** [add_hook switch f] registers [f] so it will be called when
      {!turn_off} is invoked. It does nothing if [switch] is
      [None]. If [switch] contains an switch that is already off then
      {!Off} is raised. *)

val add_hook_or_exec : t option -> (unit -> unit Lwt.t) -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [add_hook_or_exec switch f] is the same as {!add_hook} except
      that if the switch is already off, [f] is called immediately. *)
