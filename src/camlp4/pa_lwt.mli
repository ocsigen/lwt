(** Syntactic sugars for Lwt (deprecated) *)

(** This extension add the following sugars:

    - anonymous bind:

      {[
         write stdout "Hello, " >> write stdout "world!"
      ]}

      If you are mixing `>>` and `;`, you need to use parentheses or
      `begin`/`end` to get the result you expect:

      {[
        write stdout "Hello, " >> (ignore (); write stdout "world!")
      ]}

    - lwt-binding:

      {[
         lwt ch = get_char stdin in
         code
      ]}

      is the same as [bind (get_char stdin) (fun ch -> code)]

      Moreover it supports parallel binding:

      {[
         lwt x = do_something1 ()
         and y = do_something2 in
         code
      ]}

      will let [do_something1 ()] and [do_something2 ()] runs then
      bind their result to [x] and [y]. It is the same as:

      {[
         let t1 = do_something1
         and t2 = do_something2 in
         bind t1 (fun x -> bind t2 (fun y -> code))
      ]}

    - exception catching:

      {[
         try_lwt
           <expr>
      ]},

      {[
         try_lwt
           <expr>
         with
           <branches>
      ]},

      {[
         try_lwt
           <expr>
         finally
           <expr>
       ]}

    and:

      {[
         try_lwt
           <expr>
         with
           <branches>
         finally
           <expr>
      ]}

    For example:

      {[
         try_lwt
           f x
         with
           | Failure msg ->
               prerr_endline msg;
               return ()
      ]}

    is expanded to:

      {[
         catch (fun _ -> f x)
           (function
              | Failure msg ->
                  prerr_endline msg;
                  return ()
              | exn ->
                  Lwt.fail exn)
      ]}

    Note that the [exn -> Lwt.fail exn] branch is automatically addedd
    when needed.

    Note also that [finally] is evaluated {e before} [with] if an exception is
    raised. This is not the case with the newer PPX extension: there, [finally]
    is always evaluated last.

    The construction [try_lwt <expr>] just catch regular exception
    into lwt exception. i.e. it is the same as [catch (fun _ -> <expr>) fail].

    - exception raising:

      {[
        raise_lwt <expr>
      ]}

      This allow exception to be traced when the -lwt-debug switch is passed
      to the syntax extension.

    - assertion:

      {[
        assert_lwt <expr>
      ]}

    - for loop:

      {[
        for_lwt i = <expr> to <expr> do
          <expr>
        done
      ]}

    and:

      {[
        for_lwt i = <expr> downto <expr> do
          <expr>
        done
      ]}

    - iteration over streams:

      {[
        for_lwt <patt> in <expr> do
          <expr>
        done
      ]}

    - while loop:

      {[
        while_lwt <expr> do
          <expr>
        done
      ]}

    - pattern matching:

      {[
        match_lwt <expr> with
          | <patt_1> -> <expr_1>
          ...
          | <patt_n> -> <expr_n>
      ]}
*)
