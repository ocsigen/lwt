Lwt is OCaml's concurrent programming library. It provides a single data type:
the *promise*, which is a value that will become determined in the future.
Creating a promise spawns a computation. When that computation is I/O, Lwt runs
it in parallel with your OCaml code.

OCaml code, including creating and waiting on promises, is run in a single
thread by default, so you don't have to worry about locking or preemption. You
can detach code to be run in separate threads on an opt-in basis.

Here is a simplistic Lwt program which requests the Google front page, and fails
if the request is not completed in five seconds:

```ocaml
let () =
  let request =
    let%lwt addresses = Lwt_unix.getaddrinfo "google.com" "80" [] in
    let google = Lwt_unix.((List.hd addresses).ai_addr) in

    Lwt_io.(with_connection google (fun (incoming, outgoing) ->
      let%lwt () = write outgoing "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n" in
      let%lwt () = write outgoing "Connection: close\r\n\r\n" in
      let%lwt response = read incoming in
      Lwt.return (Some response)))
  in

  let timeout =
    let%lwt () = Lwt_unix.sleep 5. in
    Lwt.return None
  in

  match Lwt_main.run (Lwt.pick [request; timeout]) with
  | Some response -> print_string response
  | None -> prerr_endline "Request timed out"; exit 1

(* ocamlfind opt -package lwt.unix,lwt_ppx -linkpkg -o request example.ml
   ./request *)
```

In the program, functions such as `Lwt_io.write` create promises. The
`let%lwt ... in` construct is used to wait for a promise to become determined;
the code after `in` is scheduled to run in a "callback." `Lwt.pick` races
promises against each other, and behaves as the first one to complete.
`Lwt_main.run` forces the whole promise-computation network to be executed. All
the visible OCaml code is run in a single thread, but Lwt internally uses a
combination of worker threads and non-blocking file descriptors to resolve in
parallel the promises that do I/O.

### Overview

Lwt compiles to native code on Linux, macOS, Windows, and other systems. It's
also routinely compiled to JavaScript for the front end and Node, by js_of_ocaml
and BuckleScript.

In Lwt,

- The [core library `Lwt`][core] provides promises...
- ...and a few pure-OCaml helpers, such as promise-friendly [mutexes][mutex],
  [condition variables][cond], and [mvars][mvar].
- There is a big Unix binding, [`Lwt_unix`][unix] that binds almost every Unix
  system call. A higher-level module [`Lwt_io`][io] provides nice I/O channels.
- [`Lwt_process`][process] is for subprocess handling.
- [`Lwt_preemptive`][preemptive] spawns system threads.
- The [PPX syntax][ppx] allows using all of the above without going crazy!
- There are also some other helpers, such as [`Lwt_react`][react] for reactive
  programming. See the table of contents on the linked manual pages!

## Installing

1. Use your system package manager to install a development libev package.
   It is often called `libev-dev` or `libev-devel`.
2. `opam install conf-libev lwt`

## Documentation

We are currently working on improving the Lwt documentation (drastically; we are
rewriting the manual). In the meantime:

- The current manual can be found [here][manual].
- Mirage has a nicely-written [Lwt tutorial][mirage-tutorial].
- An example of a [simple server][counter-server] written in Lwt.
- [Concurrent Programming with Lwt][rwo-lwt] is a nice source of Lwt examples.
  They are translations of code from the excellent Real World OCaml, but are
  just as useful if you are not reading the book.

*Note: much of the current manual refers to `'a Lwt.t` as "lightweight threads"
or just "threads." This will be fixed in the new manual. `'a Lwt.t` is a
promise, and has nothing to do with system or preemptive threads.*
